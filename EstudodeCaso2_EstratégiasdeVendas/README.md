PontoMaximo, a retail store that sells electronics and home appliances with stores spread across several cities in Brazil, is setting up its sales strategy for the coming year and needs to know which of the manufacturers of the products sold has the best sales performance.

The objective is to discard manufacturers whose products have few sales and try to negotiate better conditions with the main manufacturers.
In parallel to this, the company would like to have different views of the sales made in the last 4 years (period from 2012 to 2015).

It should be possible to segment sales reports by different information and from different angles. This information will support the company's strategies for the coming year.
Its data source is an Excel file with data collected from the company's sales, CRM and ERP systems.
