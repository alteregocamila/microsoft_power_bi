The company PowerMasterLearning, a retail chain that sells electronic products and home appliances, began operating in Brazil in 2012 and operates in the four states of the Southeast region plus the states of Paran√° and Bahia.

The company is setting up its sales strategy for the next year and needs to know which of the manufacturers of the products sold has the best sales performance. The objective is to discard manufacturers whose products have few sales and try to negotiate better conditions with the main manufacturers.

In parallel to this, the company would like to have different views of the sales made in the last 4 years (period from 2012 to 2015). It should be possible to segment sales reports by different information and from different angles. This information will support the company's strategies for the coming year.

The data was extracted from different tables of a transactional database and as the company will be using the reports every month, some consultants have recommended using a Data Warehouse.

You must create a data model that allows you to extract reports at any time and that allows you to extract data from different views and angles. The data must be fed into a consolidated database, which will be updated monthly with new data.
